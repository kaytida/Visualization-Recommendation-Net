## Installation

To get started with VRN, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the VRN repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaytida/Visualization-Recommendation-Net.git
   cd vrn
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights or train your own model following the instructions in the [Training](#training) section.

## Usage

VRN is designed to recommend visualizations for input data. Here's how you can use the model:

### Dataset Preparation

Before using VRN, you need to prepare your dataset. Ensure that your data is structured and cleaned appropriately for best results.

### Training

To train your own VRN model, you can use the provided training scripts. Modify the hyperparameters and configurations in `config.yml` to suit your specific dataset and preferences. Then, run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Inference

Once you have a trained model, you can use it to make visualization recommendations. Modify the `inference.py` script to load your model and input data. Run the prediction script to get visualization recommendations:

```bash
python predict.py
```

### Evaluation

You can evaluate the performance of your VRN model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or any custom metric specific to your task. Modify the evaluation script in the `evaluate.py` file as needed.
